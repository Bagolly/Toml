WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently passes all tests in the official test suite for TOML v1.0.0, I don't want to support v1.1.0 until it's actually out. 
There's a benchmark file, the aptly named "gigatest2.toml". In Release mode, it finishes completely in about 250-280ms.

Note: he benchmar file is made by me, but unfortunately I cannot remember where I downloaded it from. If you know the source, please let me know
so tha I can attribute it properly.
