WORK IN PROGRESS

Hand written TOML v.1.0.0 parser. Currently passes all tests in the official test suite for TOML v1.0.0.
It is pretty fast (as far as C# goes), but still has room for performance optimization.


Note: the benchmark TOML file was not made by me. Unfortunately, I cannot find the original source. If you know it, please let me know
so that I can attribute it properly.
