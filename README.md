WORK IN PROGRESS

Hand written TOML v.1.0.0 parser. Currently passes all tests in the official test suite for TOML v1.0.0.
There's a benchmark file, the aptly named "gigatest2.toml". In Release mode, it finishes completely in about 250-280ms.

Note: the benchmark file was not made by me. Unfortunately, I cannot find the original source. If you know it, please let me know
so that I can attribute it properly.
